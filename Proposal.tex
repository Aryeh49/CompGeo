\section{Description}
This end result of this project will be a web application where one can shatter variably shaped objects in different ways.  The geometric aspects of this will be modelling various types of objects and then of course modelling and rendering the shattering of said objects.\\
It will be necessary to research various methods of modelling objects as well as various methods for simulating the destruction of objects with fidelity to analogous physical phenomena.  In addition to this research, I will also need to learn how to best animate the destruction of objects.
